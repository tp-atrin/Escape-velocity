# Escape velocity


Escape velocity is the speed that an object needs to be traveling to break free of a planet or moon's gravity well and leave it without further propulsion.
Escape speed at a distance d from the center of a spherically symmetric primary body (such as a star or a planet) with mass M is given by the formula:

where G is the universal gravitational constant (G ≈ 6.67*(10**-11) m3·kg−1·s−2).
The escape speed is independent of the mass of the escaping object.
Only solar system planets are available in this code.
In this equation atmospheric friction (air drag) is not taken into account.
